                     THE PASCAL-S COMPILER/INTERPRETER

============================== Description =====================================

Pascal-S was a compiler/interpreter program for a subset of the Pascal language.
It originated with Niklaus Wirth in ETH, Zurich.

The full instructions for running and setting up the Pascal-S 
compiler/interpreter have all been incorporated into the document:

doc/pascals.docx

Which is a Microsoft Word document, 2007 or later. it is also available in the
formats:

doc/pascals.pdf     Adobe Portable Document Format.
doc/pascals.html    Web page format.

Please consult one of these documents for full instructions on how to use 
Pascal-S.

============================== Quick start =====================================

Pascal-S uses the standard GNU release layout. You execute:

[Windows]

> setpath
> configure
> make

[linux]

> ./setpath
> ./configure
> make

(You can avoid "setpath" by placing the ./bin directory on your path)

This will make the compiler and interpreter set. You can then try a sample
program as:

> ps sample_programs/hello

================================== Problems ====================================

You need a working gpc implementation. It is strongly suggested you use the
gpc version 20070904. gpc has/had various compliance issues with ISO 7185, and
the compiler has ceased to be supported. This version is found to be solid.

You will need a working set of linux tooling (grep, ls, rm, etc). Mingw has
an excellent set of tools for Windows users.

You need the "flip" line ending adapation program. If you don't have it, we
include a copy you can compile, or you can simply go find it. It is a widely
available program.
